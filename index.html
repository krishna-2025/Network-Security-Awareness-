            <h2>What is Malware?</h2>
            <p>Malware, which stands for malicious software, is any program made to harm your computer, server, or network. Itâ€™s designed to cause problems or steal information. Common types of malware include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Viruses:</strong> These attach to clean files and spread throughout your computer, damaging files and data.</li>
                <li><strong>Worms:</strong> These are self-replicating programs that move across networks on their own, without needing to attach to other files.</li>
                <li><strong>Trojans:</strong> These pretend to be safe software to trick users into installing them, which then gives hackers access to the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> This locks your files and demands money to unlock them.</li>
                <li><strong>Spyware:</strong> Secretly monitors user activity and collects personal information without consent.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How to Prevent Malware:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Install reputable antivirus software and keep it updated to detect and remove malware.</li>
                <li>Regularly update your operating system and applications to patch vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li>Be cautious with downloads from unknown sources; always scan files before opening.</li>
                <li>Enable firewalls on your devices to block unauthorized access.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="phishing" class="rounded-corners">
            <h2>Understanding Phishing</h2>
            <p>Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers impersonate legitimate organizations or individuals to trick victims into providing sensitive information. This is often done through deceptive emails or websites.</p>
            <h3>Common Phishing Techniques:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Email Phishing:</strong> Fraudulent emails that appear to be from reputable sources, asking for personal information.</li>
                <li><strong>Spear Phishing:</strong> Targeted phishing attacks aimed at specific individuals or organizations.</li>
                <li><strong>Whaling:</strong> A type of spear phishing that targets high-profile individuals like executives.</li>
                <li><strong>Vishing:</strong> Voice phishing conducted over the phone, where attackers pose as legitimate entities.</li>
                <li><strong>Smishing:</strong> Phishing attempts via SMS or text messages.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How to Prevent Phishing:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Verify email sources and check for signs of phishing, such as poor grammar or suspicious links.</li>
                <li>Do not share personal information via email; legitimate organizations will never ask for sensitive information this way.</li>
                <li>Use anti-phishing tools provided by your email service to filter out suspicious emails.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use Strong Passwords:</strong> Create complex passwords that include a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using easily guessable information.</li>
                <li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication:</strong> Add an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification when logging in.</li>
                <li><strong>Regularly Update Software:</strong> Keep your operating system, applications, and antivirus software up to date to protect against vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Be Cautious on Public Wi-Fi:</strong> Avoid accessing sensitive information over public networks. Use a VPN for added security.</li>
